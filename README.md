# TaskApp

Welcome to TaskApp! This app is my personal project, designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. Below, I'll walk you through each component I used and explain how they come together to make this app functional and user-friendly.

## Components Overview

### App
This is the main component of the application. It sets up the overall structure and layout of the app, including the header, search bar, categories, and ongoing tasks. I wanted to create a seamless experience, so everything is organized within this main component.

### View
Usage: I used the View component to create containers for different sections of the app, ensuring a clean and structured layout.

### Text
Usage: The Text component is crucial for displaying text. I used it throughout the app to show titles, subtitles, and other important information.

### Image
Usage: The Image component is used to display images. I included images for the profile, search filter, and task categories to make the app visually appealing.

### TextInput
Usage: The TextInput component is where users can type in their search queries. I designed it to be user-friendly and visually integrated with the rest of the app.

### FlatList
Usage: The FlatList component allowed me to render lists efficiently, such as the task categories and ongoing tasks. This was perfect for displaying dynamic content.

### ScrollView
Usage: I used the ScrollView component to create a scrollable container for the app's content, ensuring that users can navigate through all sections comfortably.

### StatusBar
Usage: The StatusBar component is used to control the app's status bar appearance, making sure it complements the overall design.

### AntDesign
Usage: I incorporated the AntDesign component from @expo/vector-icons to display a search icon, adding a touch of functionality and style to the search bar.

#Asset Files

Here are the images I used to enhance the visual appeal of TaskApp:
profile: User profile picture.
Vector: Search filter icon.
cat1 to cat8: Images for task categories.

# Styles

I defined the styles using StyleSheet.create to ensure consistency and manageability across the app. This includes setting visual properties like colors, sizes, margins, and paddings.

# Running the App

To get TaskApp up and running, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies: npm install or yarn install
2. Start the app: expo start

Make sure you have Expo CLI installed and properly configured. Enjoy using TaskApp to keep your tasks organized and manageable!
